# AniLib
A UWP app for managing your downloaded collection of Anime, TV shows and Movies.

## Status
Under development for Windows 10

## How it works

During first time use, the user will select a directory with all the Anime/Shows/Movies they have downloaded.
AniLib will then run its parsing algorithm for every folder and match it with the respective information (metadata) from various API.

### APIs
#### Anime:
- [Kitsu.io](https://www.kitsu.io) API for all metadata

#### TV Shows:

#### Movies:
- Plan to use [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org)

## Testing
1. Download project folder
2. Open the AniLib.sln solution file through Visual Studio
3. Select Run with local machine

Currently AniLib only works with anime shows and supports single import only (one show at a time)
